drift_test.csv
    I inflicted forces randomly all over the board for a long period of time, then allowed it to return to the rest state to see whether the IMU would return to its original state. I did not end with the same yaw as I started, so we can expect that to vary between the initial and final measurements.

limits.csv
    For each of the edges of the board, I push it to its limit so that it is flush with the group. I hold it there for some time, then let the board return to the rest state for some time. I test each of the four edges once.

spin.csv
    I spin the board a quarter rotation four times, with pauses in between.

human_balancing.csv
    Just a person balancing on the board. Includes the mounting onto the board in the beginning.

*_tapping.csv
    Isolated impulse disturbances, separated by periods of no contact to allow the system to return to the equilibrium state. This is the data that is useful for calibrating the SysID.

static/%d.csv
    Data recorded with a completely still balance board.
